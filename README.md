❓ This is the repository for my fullstack project Journal app which took over 200 hours to make! This readme includes the documentation, the code for the frontend and the backend. See below for more screenshots and info.

💻 Deployed at https://fullstack-project-rxtv.onrender.com/. Note that it may take few minutes to connect since Render automatically spins down free apps. You can use any email to register, it isn't verified. For demo purposes you can use for example `mail@example.com` and password `password123`.

>[!TIP]
>  ⭐ New features! This app now has i18n translations! Languages are English and Finnish. There are other changes too, see releases for full patch notes!

<h2>Running the app 🏃</h2>

This project has three different Firebase Auth and MongoDB credentials: development, testing and production.

See [here](./documentation/running.md) for information how to run.

<h2>Test coverage 🔬</h2>

This project uses Cypress for E2E testing. Almost every aspect has a E2E test, excluding some map elements where automated testing isn't possible due to Mapbox's limitations.

Backend has been throughly tested with Hoppscotch when changes have been made to it. Automated testing seems to be impossible due to auth being handled by Firebase Auth and you need your ID and token for every request.

See [here](./frontend/cypress/e2e/test.cy.ts) for tests.
